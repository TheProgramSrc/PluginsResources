# PluginsResources
A repository that will work as DataBase for our plugins


## Resources:<br>
â€¢ [SuperAuth - Translations](https://github.com/TheProgramSrc/PluginsResources/tree/master/superauth)

## Translations
`1)` Choose a Plugin Folder<br>
`2)` Copy the translation "en.yml"<br>
`3)` Translate the file, but make sure to keep the Placeholders and Identifiers in english to avoid bugs<br>
`4)` Create a new pull request<br>
`5)` Wait for Approval<br>

_NOTE: If you're translating Songoda and SpigotMC Pages make sure to use the default BBCode for every page because they don't have the same format_

## Unknown Character Bug with Translations 
Make sure to add `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` to the command when you start your server like: `java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar server.jar`
